# Ransomware Simulation

This project simulates ransomware behavior by allowing users to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption. It was created by Shaheer Saud as a demonstration of cryptographic techniques.


Live Demo: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (HAHA)

## Features

- Encrypt files using AES encryption
- Decrypt files that were encrypted using this tool
- Simple web interface for uploading files to be encrypted or decrypted

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for developing the encryption and decryption logic.
- Flask: A lightweight web framework used to create the web application.
- PyCryptoDome: A Python library for cryptographic operations, used to implement AES encryption.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework used to style the web interface and ensure it is responsive and user-friendly.
- Gunicorn: A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX used to serve the application.
